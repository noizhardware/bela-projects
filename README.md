# bela-projects

----

Got really excited with the Bela Mini, just made my first working patch using externals "freeverb00"

at the moment I found that it works if you just put the externals in the same folder of the project.
the externals must be compiled for linux, here https://github.com/critterandguitari/Organelle_pd_extra I found the puredata-extended externals all nice and compiled for linux!
