# BELA projects

----

Got really excited with the Bela Mini, just made my first working patch using externals "freeverb00", a simple reverb.
Using the latest version of the Bela firmware, available [here](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/archive/master.zip)

* beater00 uses the abstraction "nanok3" (you can find the up-to-date version [here](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/archive/master.zip) to receive data from a connected Korg Nano usb-midi controller.

* The externals can be in the same folder of your project, or in /root/Bela/projects/pd-externals
* The externals must be compiled for linux, here https://github.com/critterandguitari/Organelle_pd_extra I found the puredata-extended externals all nice and compiled for linux!
